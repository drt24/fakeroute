`fakeroute` is a simple tool that simulates network topologies by intercepting
`traceroute`-like probes towards a set of IP addresses. Topologies are made of
text files describing the successive links, allowing for the presence of load
balancers. The tool has been designed to test `traceroute`-like programs.
