fakeroute requires the following python modules to be installed:
 - python-nfqueue
 - python-dpkt
 - python-dumbnet
 - python-netfilter

fakeroute-plot additionally requires:
 - python-pydot

Both programs require the presence of a directory named 'targets' in one of the
following locations:
 - ./targets
 - ~/.fakeroute/targets
 - /etc/fakeroute/targets

This directory should contain the different simulated topologies, named after
the target destination IP (see the README files for more details, including the
format of those files).
